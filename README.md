# Adventure-Works-Sales-Analysis---Power-BI
A visualisation and breakdown of sales for an outdoor activities retailer

In the top right, a bar chart and line chart visualising the sum of sales and profit margin by month. Below that, a stacked bar chart breaking down sales by group and category, and a horizontal bar chart breaking down the sum of sales by category.
These can then be dynamically filtered further by the year drop-down, and the region list.
